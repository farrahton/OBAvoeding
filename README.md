Voeding en diÃ«tiek
Als sportieve twintiger wil ik mij verdiepen in het effect van gezonde voeding op mijn conditie, om te leren hoe ik mijn sport beter kan beoefenen. </i>

On this website a person can find all the necessary information about food and fitness given by oba. The user can find events, books, audiobooks and more to get inspired and motivated. If given more time it would also have had more self-written content with fun (good to know) facts about food and how it can affect ones body in combination with working out. Moreover, it would have an introduction with a form that asks for the persons lifestyle, goals in food and fitness, and their learning style (visual, text, hearing, deep dive, summary etc.) to help them with the right recommendations from filtered data. Currently there are still some irrelevant recommendations and the state with the form is also not incorporated.
